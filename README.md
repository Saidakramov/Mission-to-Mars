# Mission-to-Mars

- During this module challenge, our objectives were to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

- Every object was completed. There are three required changes to a website which are: 
  - The webpage is mobile responsive.
  - Button color, background, and header background colors are changed
  - Facts table is customized.
